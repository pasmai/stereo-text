# stereo-text
Program that turns text into an stereogram image so that certain words pop out with a 3d effect.
All words in the input **marked as \<text> will be 3D.**

-----
**How to use:**

* Start it over cmd or by executing the 3dtext.py and then it allows you to type in the text
* pass the text as command line argument. (e.g. 3dtext.py "you can <enter> your text <here>" )
```
It works by replacing the < on the left side with different number of spaces than the version on the right.
I was inspired by this website. (They also have 3D Tetris :)
Examples:
* Whatever space or place  * Whatever space or place  *
*  you be - Whatever life  * you  be - Whatever life  *
* you've known - What's    * you've known - What's    *
* true for you is not for  * true for you is not for  *
* me: To each,  my friend, * me: To each, my friend,  *
* their own. No matter     * their own. No matter     *
* wisdom, age, or youth, O * wisdom, age, or youth, O *
* how  you choose to test  * how you  choose to test  *
* - You'll never really    * - You'll never really    *
* find the truth. Except   * find the truth. Except   *
* that mine's  the best.   * that mine's the best.    *```
